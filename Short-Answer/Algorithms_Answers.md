#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) O(n) 


b)
  O(nlog(n))) j in the inner loops keeps getting bigger every time the function runs

c)
O(n) since we subtract by on the function is only being call n times 

## Exercise II

    I would just start at the halfway point and test if it breaks, if it does I would eliminate the top half and keep doing this until I find a point where it does not. This call binary search.
